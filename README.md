Cisco XML application toolkit
=============================

This library enables the creation of interactive applications for Cisco IP
phones. As of yet, it has been tested only with the SPA500 series. A brief usage
example is given in ```index.php```.

Caution
-------

For some reason, these phones tend to be fairly crash prone. Test your code
repeatedly in a staging environment before rolling your application out to
mission critical devices!
